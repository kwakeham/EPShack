EPS-Holder-MKII is a -6 degree stem. 11mm spacer

The spacer design is 11mm (rather than 10) to better accomadate the 10mm height on the -6 degree slope. It just worked out this way. You'll need about 10mm of spacer abover it and the EPS unit can't be installed with the stem in place (opps?)

It's designed for about 0.8mm of total clearance on a standard 1.125" (28.6mm approx) steam (0.4mm either side). However my printer + shrinkage meant that its more like 0.2 - 0.4mm total. 

STL files should be printed such that the layers wrap around the bulk of the length (flat side edges down). Mirror the design in CAD (step) or 3d printing software to filp the edges. Don't print using supports. The overhang is very small and most machines are capable without support, but if you use support you'll have a issue getting it out.
