The spacer design to relocate the bottlecage slightly higher. This enabled a small 3mm hole to be drilled into a hex screw. This requires cutting and soldering the cable. It's suggested to stagger the splices if possible, but in some cases due to the short wires there are little choice and the splices are all at the same point.

Use a linesman splice to keep the size small. Small heat shrink tubing in necessary.
