There are 4 designs here
Button26 - Truncated design (only 90 degree) for 26mm bars
Button26f - Design with 22mm ID for stretch to 26mm bars
Button318 - Truncated design (only 80 degree) for 31.8mm bars
Button318f - Design with 28mm ID for stretch to 31.8mm bars

STL files should be printed such that the layers wrap around the bulk of the length (flat side edges down). Mirror the design in CAD (step) or 3d printing software to filp the edges.

Switches to be used are Panasonic EVQ-3PLA15

357gram-force feels good inside, the switch makes a good audible click but outside a higher force seems to be desirable.

This design is NOT waterproof. I've attempted multiple methods to waterproof it, but no success yet. My plan is to revise this design with Tact switches that are waterproof and over 600gram-force, englarge the design for a PCB, and secure it with an adhesive.

Solder the small wires onto the edges of the switch and not the bottom or else the increase in height
